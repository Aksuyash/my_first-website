		<h2> My First Website</h2>
		<p class="one"> Today, 5th of August, 2015, I finished my first HTML/CSS course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web" target=_blank>Codecademy.</a> The Journey of my coding began with codecademy. I Have finished HTML/CSS and also learning some javascripts. AS i started playing with it, its more fun. The challenge i found during the coding is remembering some tags like what it does. now, i figured out that it would be easy if i peek back to what i did or to write a note in a notebbok is really helpful.</p>

		<p class="one"> Now, I would like to tell Something about Myself.
			While studying half way through codecademy, i became interested in web development. So i started to search about web development. I found out few boot camps but were too expensive. Then later i saw a course on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/"target=_blank> Udemy </a>  for web development. This course is by Rob Percival. He has explained the importance of developer very nicely. He has a five star rating and instructs very well. Now I am in 15 % of this course and learning more about HTML tags. So for now i will only show you the things on HTML, But later I will Use CSS and more...</p>
